When I was a sophomore my professor told me that there was a comfortable tool that helped utilize AI easily. I got interested and thought what I could make with it. I decided to make a deep learning sandbag with it. Though I used a comfortable tool to implement deep learning at the time, I'd like to study machine learning enough and make a better deep learning sandbag on my own soon.

## How to play
* Set your position so that the camera can recognize you and wait.
* Beat the sandbag as you want freely.
* You can do : left punch, right punch, side kick to beat the sandbag.
